## Vue & Tailwind components

This directory contains components written using Vuejs & Tailwind.


## How to use

Vue has a convenient built-in way to serve a single component, which I've wrapped to make it even more convenient.

Just type:
 ```
 yarn show 'name of the file to show'
 ```
Vue will open your default browser and serve the component you've asked for.

/!\ Tailwind is served through its CDN, you'll need to swap it out when using in a real app.

More info on why using Tailwind's CDN in production is a bad idea **[here.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/#using-tailwind-via-cdn)**
